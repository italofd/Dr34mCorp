### What is dr34m?

- dr34m was created as a ragnarok guild in 2009, formed by brazilians players and friends, since then things have grown and developed to something different than a ragnarok guild, right now is much more a community, a group of friends that likes to chat, work together and also play a lot of games in the spare time. The group has also got bigger over the years, bringing a diversity comunity that share common desires but not the same culture, life experiences and so on, leading us to intense conversations and brainstorming on every day base.

- dr34mCorp is just an ideia, a place that we gonna execute our plans and projects, the group has a lot of devs that are passionate about getting their ideias out of their mind and transform into code, this is the place where all gona be displayed and used by dr34m members. It's a wide project that ment to always be growing and absorving new ideias from our members, right now the goal for the mvp is a radio for dr34m members, a portfolio to show all of us and what each one likes, think or just wants to share something!
